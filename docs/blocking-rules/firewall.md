# Firewall

!!! info
    Firewall blocking rules available at [{{ config.repo_url }}tree/master/data/firewall]({{ config.repo_url }}tree/master/data/firewall)

Some queries use IPs addresses but you can stop them with your Firewall.

All relative information about these IP addresses are listed in the CSV files `firewall-` in
[**logs**]({{ config.repo_url }}/tree/master/logs) folder.

To add/remove firewall rules or test IPs, read the instructions on the [Firewall app](../app/telemetry/firewall.md)
page.
